<h3>🔍 How It Works</h3>
1. Scroll to 'Explore Our Car Catalogue'. <br>
2. Type in the car make and model. <br>
3. Data will be fetched, and you'll see the desired car along with its image. <br>
4. Hover over a car card and press the 'View More' button to see additional info about the car as well as different angles. <br> <br>

Note: At present, fetching images may be slow and there is no loading indicator. <br>
This functionality is currently being tested and will soon be uploaded to the main website. <br>
